# MicroRNA Regulation in NaÃ¯ve T Cell Subsets

This repository contains code for the paper:  
**"An efficient framework to decipher microRNA regulatory programs applied to T cells"**  
ðŸ“„ [Read the paper on Genes & Immunity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-025-00351-5)

## Code Overview
- Presented miR-Inf, an effecient framework for identifying and characterizing microRNA regulatory programs.
- Analyzed RNA-seq and small RNA-seq datasets in T cells.
- Applied miR-Inf in T cells to uncover microRNAâ€“gene interactions shaping T cell biology.
